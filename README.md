The brnn Package ([Pérez-Rodríguez et al, 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23658327/)) implements Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks 
with a single hidden layer for continuous response. The software is also able to deal ordinal 
responses ([Pérez-Rodríguez et al, 2020](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tpg2.20021/)). 
This repository is a copy of the stable version which can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brnn/index.html).
